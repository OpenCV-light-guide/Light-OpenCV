# OpenCV Basics

## Description
This repository serves as a reference guide to the fundamental functions and methods of the OpenCV library, commonly used in computer vision, image processing, and machine learning tasks. OpenCV is a popular open-source library designed for image and video processing, as well as for various computer vision tasks.

## Structure
The repository is organized into the following sections:

### 1. Image Input and Output
   - Reading and writing images
   - Working with video files
   - Loading and saving images from/to webcam

### 2. Image Processing
   - Resizing images
   - Adjusting brightness, contrast, and hue of images
   - Color space transformations
   - Cropping, rotating, and flipping images
   - Image filtering (blurring, edge enhancement, etc.)

### 3. Object Detection
   - Face detection
   - Object detection using Haar cascades
   - Contour detection of objects

### 4. Basics of Computer Vision
   - Image transformations (rotation, perspective transformation, etc.)
   - Key point detection and descriptors
   - Image matching

### 5. Usage Examples
   - Several examples demonstrating the usage of basic OpenCV functions with comments and explanations.

## Additional Information
Additional resources such as documentation, links to articles, and guides can be found in their respective sections.
